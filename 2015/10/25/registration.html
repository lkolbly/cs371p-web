    <p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p>If you&#39;re reading this, then you&#39;re either taking this class in Fall 2015 or you&#39;re considering taking it this coming Spring, 2016.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re considering registering for CS371p, Object Oriented Programming with Downing, G., then good for you. You&#39;re going to learn C++.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I can promise you. This is either good news or bad news, depending on your opinions.</p>

<p>Dr. Downing does an excellent job teaching C++, and is truly an excellent lecturer in many ways. The projects are easy, and the tests are straightforward, so if these are qualities that you like in a class then by all means take it.</p>

<p>If you want to learn about anything other than C++, then abandon all hope, ye you enter here. This is not a theory class, do not expect to learn anything that can be applied anywhere else. If you are of the opinion that going to lecture for 3 hours a week to learn a new programming language is silly, because either a) you think that juniors in a CS program should be able to pick up a new language without someone spoon-feeding it to them, or b) you think that C++ will be obsolete in a few years, then don&#39;t take this class.</p>

<p>If you think (b), then our hopes are aligned, but unfortunately far-fetched. C++ has been around longer than you or I.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. These are my thoughts on the class shrunk to 250 words.</p>

<p>Tip of the Week: <a href="http://www.multicore-association.org/workgroup/mpp.php">http://www.multicore-association.org/workgroup/mpp.php</a></p>

<p>The ability to program multi-core systems is crucial as humanity hits the computational speed barrier. We&#39;re at 16nm now in iPads, chips can only become so small. A group of people got together and made this platform-agnostic guide to programming on multi-core systems. It condenses the material well if you&#39;re into that sort of thing (namely, programming for performance).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you do have to give them your email address to get the PDF. It&#39;s probably elsewhere on the internet if you searched around, though.</p>
