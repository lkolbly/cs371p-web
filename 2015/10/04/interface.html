    <p>The creator of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) once said: &quot;There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.&quot;</p>

<p>This week we covered more about templates and we started covering lambda functions.</p>

<p>I personally like lambda functions. Sometimes, it is handy to have a full function that you can toss around to different functions. The C++ standard library&#39;s accumulat() and all_of() functions both take a function as a parameter. In a language like Python that lambda would be restricted to a single statement, and scoping becomes a little less clear. C++ fixes these problems and allows arbitrarily sized lambdas with clearly scoped variables.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, lambdas went the way of templates, and maybe could&#39;ve had a little more thought put into them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;

using namespace std;

function&lt;int(int)&gt; foo()
{
  int i = 2;
  return [&amp;i] (int x) -&gt; int {return i+x+1;};
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  function&lt;int(int)&gt; fn = foo();
  cout &lt;&lt; fn(5) &lt;&lt; endl;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Prints out 6 on my machine. There are many camps on language design. The camp I belong to believes that the language should protect the coder in a case like this, using what JavaScript does with closures or Python with reference counting.</p>

<p>This blog is about the class, not the language, so I shall tie it together: This class is making me think about language design more than any other class I&#39;ve taken. I don&#39;t like C++. But the professor makes an argument for it, and it makes me think hard about what it is that I like and don&#39;t like in languages.</p>

<p>This is one thing I like about this class. It makes you to think.</p>

<p>Tip of the Week: Have experience writing big projects from scratch (&gt;2000 lines, and multiple files). Most classes value good code but don&#39;t teach architecture, but having a good architecture is more important. Good architecture leads to good code. Bad architecture leads to code that has to work around the program it&#39;s living in, and it becomes more of a headache the further you get down the line.</p>
