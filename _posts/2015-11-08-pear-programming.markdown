I've been here before.

But never hit a wall.

I've spent a lifetime coding.

And I always get it done.

But with you I'm coding something

that makes me have to test.



I'm prepared for this.

I never shoot to test.

But I feel like a storm is coming.

If I'm gonna make it to an A,

then there's no more use in running

this is something I gotta face.



If I risk it all,

could you curve my Fall?



How do I live? How do I breathe?

When you're here I'm test writing.

I want to write code, run through my lines,

tell me is this where I lose all my points?

For you I have to test it all

'cause the writing's on the wall.



A million lines of tests

That haunt us from the spec,

As the stars begin to gather,

and the light begins to fade,

when all hope begins to shatter,

know that I'll still write tests.



If I risk it all,

could you curve my Fall?



How do I live? How do I breathe?

When you're here I'm test writing.

I want to write functions, not silly tests,

tell me is this worth three unit tests?

For you I have to test it all

'cause the writing's in the spec.



The writing's in the spec.



How do I live? How do I breathe?

When you're here I'm test writing.

I want to write code, not many silly tests,

tell me is this industry standard?



How do I live? Tip of the week:

When you're writing APIs, use the API.

Know the useful parts, cut out the rest,

tell me what's an unused interface?

For this you have to use it all

'cause the user's at the end.
