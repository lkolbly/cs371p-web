        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say that a first impression is the strongest impression. I&amp;#39;m currently reading the book &amp;quot;Blink&amp;quot;, by Malcolm Gladwell (author of &amp;quot;The Tipping Point&amp;quot;), which speaks only of this phenomenon for 300 pages. A good read, actually, I highly recommend it, though it does come off a little bit like Stephan Wolfram&amp;#39;s book &amp;quot;A New Kind of Science&amp;quot; (which is also worth reading).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I digress. What does this have to do with Professor Downing&amp;#39;s class, CS 371P (Object Oriented Programming) at UT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glenn Downing is an award-winning teacher. He&amp;#39;s worked at JPL, Los Alamos, and MCC, he&amp;#39;s won three teaching awards, and he holds a patent in a &amp;quot;System and method for initializing variables in an object-oriented program&amp;quot;. He has a daughter that he&amp;#39;s very proud of, he seems like a great guy to be around, your typical case for teacher of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except that he&amp;#39;s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair warning: I have a personal bias against C++, and I have a personal bias against people who put their curly braces after their return statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;int main() {
   cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; endl;
   return 0;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can I trust a Lisp programmer? Although I guess if it were in true Lisp form it&amp;#39;d look more like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;(&amp;lt;&amp;lt; (&amp;lt;&amp;lt; cout &amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;) endl)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m clearly not a Lisp coder, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on a serious note, putting code into a header file is wrong. It leads to multiple dependency errors in large projects, in the case where you have 2 C++ files, each of which includes the same header, and then the two C++ files are later linked together. Also it&amp;#39;s inefficient, because a change to the code results in recompiling every file that included it, and so forth. I did a quick internet search using Google and someone mentioned cyclical dependencies, which is a good point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the particular case of the class, it only became an issue because of the way gcov aggregates its statistics on a per-file basis, and the makefile for the class was checking the C++ file for the coverage statistics of the function in question, not the header file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;$ gcov -b ./Coverage2.c++ | grep -A 5 &amp;quot;File &amp;#39;Coverage2.c++&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
instead of:
$ gcov -b ./Coverage2.c++ | grep -A 5 &amp;quot;File &amp;#39;Collatz2.h&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;#39;s that. To be fair, it is just one example (four, actually), but strong C/C++ knowledge is not a prereq for this class, so some people may take the idea to heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while I take issue with the materials that have been presented thus far in class, the teaching style of the class is one I rather like. Professor Downing does the unique practice of calling on people in class and putting them on the spot. I think this practice is wonderful and should be in all classes - it forces a student to think, on the spot, about a problem, like a triage of sorts. I&amp;#39;m not a fan of competitive coding, hackathons, or that type of thing, because I find them too stressful of a hobby (if you want me to be stressed, you have to pay me, a prize is not money in the bank). But one thing that they teach is the ability to triage a situation and go in a direction, and not freeze or over-analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should speak some words also about how this class seems to be emphasizing the tools more than the programming itself. Namely, Github, Travis CI, gcov, doxygen, etc. Personally I think any programmer worth their weight in gold [1] should be able to pick up these tools in any given weekend, so a class is pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I see is that I have issues with the material presented in class, but the material is at least well-taught. I opened talking about first impressions - we&amp;#39;ve only had two classes so far, and no homework or projects, so I&amp;#39;m going to keep an open mind and we&amp;#39;ll see how this next (first) project goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A programming tip of the week: If you need to read 1.7 million images into Apache Spark, don&amp;#39;t use binaryFiles on a directory of 1.7 million files. binaryFiles will spend literally hours building a table of all the files and will eventually return an OutOfMemory exception. Instead, base64 encode the files into lines, and put each line into a big gzipped file, and read it with textFiles (you can also have several big gzipped files, and spread the little files across them). The gzipping almost offsets the size expansion of the base64 step, at least in my case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;#39;t need to load them into Spark, don&amp;#39;t put 1.7 million images into a flat directory anyway, because it takes several minutes to read the directory listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] $16,524/LB at time of writing, $3.2 million for the average male and $2.7 million for the average female, which coincidentally matches the lifetime earnings of a male or female ($3.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively) with a PhD, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf&quot;&gt;a 2009 report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce&lt;/a&gt; page 10. New theory: Women are discriminated against not because of their gender, but because of their weight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, welcome to Lane Kolbly&amp;#39;s blog for CS371P (Object Oriented Programming)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run this blog because I get extra credit in the class, and this blog is for the class.&lt;/p&gt;
